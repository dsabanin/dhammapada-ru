This is a Dhammapada generating script. It prints random Dhammapada verse in Russian. 

I'm using it in combination with GeekTool:

GeekTool allows me to print output of any command on the desktop, and I'm using this script to print Dhammapada verses.

Dhammapada translation itself was taken from here:

Maybe somebody will find this useful too.
